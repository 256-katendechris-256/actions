Backend Setup
Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/256-katendechris-256/GROUP_BSE24-1.git
cd GROUP_BSE24-1/backend
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder. Add the following environment variables:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
After completing the setup, the application can be accessed by opening the following URLs:

Backend (API): http://localhost:3001
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
How It Works:
User Registration/Authentication: New users must register with a username and password. Authentication is handled via JWT.

Chat Rooms: Once authenticated, users can join or create chat rooms.

Messaging: Real-time messaging is enabled through WebSockets.

Features
User Authentication
Secure login and signup using JWT.
Real-Time Communication
Real-time communication between users using WebSockets (Socket.IO).
Chat Rooms
Multiple users can join the same chat room and exchange messages in real time.
User-friendly UI
Responsive, easy-to-use interface built with React.
Future Enhancements
Private Messaging: Enable one-on-one conversations between users.
File Sharing: Allow users to share files within chat rooms.
Message Encryption: Encrypt messages to ensure secure communication.
Push Notifications: Notify users of new messages even when they're not active on the app.
